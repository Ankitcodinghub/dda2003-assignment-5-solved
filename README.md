3 Instruction

3.1 Data Format

GeoJSON is a format used to represent geographic structures (a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features). A GeoJSON object can contain features of the following types: Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection, Feature, or FeatureCollection. If you‚Äôre curious, check out the spec38 for more information. There are many sources of GeoJSON files. In this assignment, we use Natural Earth39, which is a large collection of public domain map data of various features, locations, and granularities.

Once the .json data is read successfully, we can see the following output, shown in Figure 3.

(a) (b) (c)

Figure 3: Data structure in GeoJSON.

Next, we read a .csv data set to show population growth. The output of this .csv file is shown in Figure 4.

3.2 Process Data

3.3 Projection

Despite what flat-earthers might say, the Earth is a sphere. When representing it on a 2D screen, we‚Äôll need to create some rules ‚Äî these rules are the projection. Imagine peeling an orange and turning the skin into a flat sheet ‚Äî even with slicing it in various places, it‚Äôs impossible to do perfectly. Projections will use a combination of distortion (stretching parts of the map) and slicing to approximate the Earth‚Äôs actual shape. There are many projections out there. D3-geo has 15 projections built in, but many more in a D3 module that‚Äôs not included in the core build: D3-geo-projection. Figure 5 shows a collection of different projections.

You are asked to choose one projection method to visualize the geospatial data using the D3-geo or D3-geo-projection library. It is not required to choose the same projection as shown in Figure 1.

Each of the projections are implemented in either d3-geo or d3-geoprojection. We can use these projection functions to convert from [longitude, latitude] coordinates to [x, y] pixel coordinates. Essentially, a projection function is a scale in the geographic world. Each projection function has its own default size (i.e., range). But we want our projection to be the same width as our bounds. To update our projection‚Äôs width, we can use its .fitWidth() method, which takes two parameters: (1) the width in pixels and (2). a GeoJSON object. When we call this method, our projection will update its size so that the GeoJSON object (2) we pass will be the specified width (1). Similarly, to get the height, we can use d3.geoPath() is similar to the line generator (d3.line()). When we pass it our projection, it will create a generator function that will help us create our geographical shapes. An output of d3.geoPath() is shown in Figure 6. Next, we also need to find out how tall the path would be. d3.geoPath() has a .bounds() method that will return an array of [x, y] coordinates describing a bounding box of a specified GeoJSON object.

Figure 5: Collection of projections.

3.4 Color Scale

Next, we need to create our scales. Typically, we would create x and y scales, but those are covered by our projection. We‚Äôll only need a scale to help us turn our metric values (population growth amounts) into color values. We can grab all of the population growth values by using Object.values(), which returns an object‚Äôs values in an array. Then we can extract the smallest and largest values by using d3.extent().

While we can create scales that have one minimum and one maximum value for both their domain and range. But we would like to create piecewise

Figure 6: Data structure of d3.geoPath().

scales, which are basically multiple scales in one. If we use a domain and range with more than two values, d3 will create a scale with more than two ‚Äúanchors‚Äù. In this case, we want to create a scale with a ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù population growth of 0% that converts to a middle color of white. Population growth amounts above 0 should be converted with a color scale from white (0) to green (5), and population growth amounts below 0 should be converted with a color scale from red (-2) to white (0). Creating a piecewise scale like this is easier than it seems: just add a middle value to the domain and the range. A possible choice is that.

‚Ä¢ create a scale which scales evenly on both sides (eg. .domain([-5, 0, 5])). This approach will let the viewer see if countries are shrinking at the same pace as countries that are growing, since a light red (-2.5%) will correlate to a light green (2.5%).

‚Ä¢ create a scale which scales unevenly from white to red and white to green (eg. .domain([-2, 0, 5])). This approach will maximize the color scale, making distinctions between countries with different growth rates clear. However, it can be confusing when a light red color (-0.1%) doesn‚Äôt match the scale of a light green color (2.5%).

An example of a color scale is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Color scale.

3.5 Visualize Data

Next, we‚Äôll bind our data to our selection object. Because d3 will create one element per item in the dataset we pass to .data(), we‚Äôll want to use the list of features instead of the whole object. Next, we‚Äôll use .enter().append(‚Äùpath‚Äù) to tell d3 to create one new ¬°path¬ø for each item in our list of countries. We‚Äôll give each of these ¬°path¬øs a class of ‚Äùcountry‚Äù and then pass it straight to our pathGenerator() to get a d string, generating the shape of each country. The last is we want to color our countries based on their population growth amount. We‚Äôll need to set their fill by looking up the country‚Äôs id in the metricDataByCountry object we created at the top of our file, then passing that id to our colorScale(). Since some countries might be missing from our dataset, we‚Äôll want to indicate that on our map by coloring them white.

3.6 Mark location

One of the fun parts of building in the browser is that we can interact with the user. Let‚Äôs take advantage of this by showing user‚Äôs location on the map. Modern browsers have a global navigator object, which provides information about the device accessing the website. navigator.geolocation has a method for grabbing the browser‚Äôs location: .getCurrentPosition(). We can pass .getCurrentPosition() a callback function that has the user‚Äôs location. The browser will ask to access our location the first time we load the page. The callback will only run if we click Allow. After clicking allow, we can see the user‚Äôs current location on the map, as shown in Figure 8.

3.7 Set Up Interactions

Lastly, we need to give the user more information when they hover over a country. First, we want to initialize our mouse events using the .on() method for our countries‚Äô elements. Next, we want to grab the tooltip element ‚Äî this is already created in our index.html file. Having a static tooltip reference outside of our mouse event callbacks keeps us from having to look it up every time a country is hovered. Next, let‚Äôs initialize our onMouseEnter() and onMouseLeave() callback functions and have them toggle our tooltip‚Äôs visibility. Next, let‚Äôs populate the text of our tooltip. Remember that the first parameter of our mouse event (that we‚Äôve named datum) contains the data bound to the hovered element. We can use this to grab the country name and population growth value. We can check the index.html file to find

Figure 8: Mark location.

the ids of the elements which will contain this text. In order to know where to position the tooltip, the pathGenerator also has a .centroid() method that will give us the center of the passed GeoJSON object. Let‚Äôs see what we get when we ask for the center of our hovered country‚Äôs bound data. Remember that we want to shift the information with our top and left margins, since our tooltip element lives outside of our bounds. We‚Äôll need to use calc() to accommodate the tooltip‚Äôs own width and height.
